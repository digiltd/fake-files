# Dummy files to quickly associate batch filetypes with a particular app

It really pisses me off when I double click an mp3 and I spot the iTunes icon bouncing up and down in my dock. No iTunes, I don't want to import every single sound file into the abyss that is the iTunes Music Library.

The process of pressing ⌘+i to change the "open with" setting and clicking "change all" is easy enough. But no matter how often you do it, sooner or later iTunes will snatch it back.

The same is true with text based files. Xcode, TextEdit and Preview will take ages to load something that Sublime would open almost instantly. I shudder at the times a csv was opened in Apple's Numbers.

So I knocked up some plain text files with various extensions so I could highlight them all and ⌘+⌥+i to get multiple item info as one pane and do a batch change all so that:

* Code opens in Sublime
* Media opens in the superfast MPV

It comes in surprisingly handy after an iTunes or OS X update, or when you reset LaunchServices.
